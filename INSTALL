This program does not unfortunately use the configure script, but I have been
careful to write is as portably as possible -- it should only be using ISO C.

In fact the only non-portable part is perhaps the Makefile for non UNIX-like
systems.


UNIX-like systems
=================

To build the software on unix, or a compatible build system (eg. cygwin),
type the following:

    cd src
    make

Then copy the casm executable wherever you want.  The documentation in the doc
directory can also be copied wherever.

The documentation is supplied pre-built, but if local changes are made it can
be regenerated by:

    cd doc
    make

Note that the documentation relies on asciidoc.


Other or broken systems
=======================

If the Makefile is not usable on your system, you simply need to compile all
the .c files and produce a single casm object.  E.g. (using the cc command
as an example):

    cd src
    cc -o casm *.c
